# Installation

Download the lastest release and extract the ZIP file. Move the `addons` folder to the root of your project. It's that easy!

If you want more information about installing plugins in Godot, please refer to [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

If you're downloading the repository instead, make sure to move only `dialog_plugin` to you `addons` folder. Extra folders are for debug purposes.
