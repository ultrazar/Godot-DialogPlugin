### 2. Extract the ZIP file

Move the `addons` folder to the root of your project _\(where is supposed to be your `project.godot` file and all files related to your Godot project\)_. It's that easy!

If you want more information about installing plugins in Godot, please refer to [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).
{% endhint %}

## Enable the plugin

After you move the plugin to your `addons` folder, open your godot project \(if it's not already opened\) and go to `Project > Project Settings... > Plugins`. Then, look for the plugin and click on `Enable` checkbox. I'll freeze the editor for a second and it'll let you know when everything is ready.
