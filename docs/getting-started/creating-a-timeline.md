# Creating a Timeline

1. First, create a timeline, inside the Dialog Editor tab.

   After activating the plugin, go to Dialog Editor tab. It should be next to `AssetLib` tab.

   Then, click on `Timelines` button and `New` button.

2. Add some events to that timeline. A timeline without events will not work, and will halt your game if you try to use it.

> **Note**: you can also can create timelines and events through code if you preffer.
