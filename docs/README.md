{% hint style="danger" %}
_**This plugin is not ready for use**_, yet. Stills in beta phase, wich means there'll be a lot of changes that'll break the code over and over again.

You can try it anyway, but be sure to make a copy of your dialog files. The format will not change, but, just in case.
{% endhint %}
